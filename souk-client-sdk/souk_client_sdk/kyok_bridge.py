"""Optional Keep Your Own Key bridge: lets a souk-client-sdk caller pay
for a run's LLM usage with their own key instead of leaving that to the
agent provider. Purely additive — a caller that never touches this module
is simply not offering KYOK; `SoukClient.run()` alone is a complete,
ordinary caller either way. See docs/keep-your-own-key.md in the souk
repo for the design, and the gateway repo's docs/server-mode.md for the
wire protocol this speaks.

**Experimental** — see tests/test_kyok_bridge.py for this module's
coverage (souk-client-sdk's only tests today). This bridge still holds
no state that survives a crash: if this process dies mid-run, souk fails
the completions it was holding and the run's provider sees errors, with
no retry/resume path on either end. Matches the same "experimental,
in-memory, single-process" status as its souk-side counterpart.

The transport is one WebSocket to the gateway's `/ws/kyok`, held for the
run's whole duration: souk pushes each `completionRequest` down it, and
this bridge streams the real LLM's chunks back as frames on the same
socket, multiplexed by requestId — concurrent completions just interleave.
The `sessionId` sent in `hello` is minted here, locally — souk neither
issues nor verifies one, it takes whichever first appears and routes by
it. **So knowing it is the entire proof**, which is why `open()` mints 128
bits of `secrets` rather than anything guessable or derived.

It is sent here and nowhere else, and that is the fix rather than the
design: souk used to put this id verbatim inside the KYOK token it gave
every provider, and a token is signed rather than sealed. Any provider
could decode its own, open this socket under the caller's session, and be
handed another provider's completion — a prompt to read and an answer to
write, which is injected tool input for whatever acts on it. Core now puts
`session_routing_key(id)`, a SHA-256, in the token instead, and derives
the same key from whatever a bridge presents. This side is unchanged
because this side is the one holding the preimage.

An answer is only accepted on the socket its request was delivered to, so
a reconnect starts fresh: completions in flight on a dead socket are
failed by souk immediately rather than retried here.

Uses litellm (https://github.com/BerriAI/litellm) to actually call the
real LLM, so this bridge isn't tied to one provider — model strings are
litellm's own ("anthropic/claude-...", "gemini/...", "openai/...", a
custom OpenAI-compatible `api_base`, ...) and its streaming chunks are
already OpenAI-shaped, which is exactly what souk's relay expects: no
translation layer needed here, just forward what litellm already gives us.
