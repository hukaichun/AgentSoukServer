"""Tools that let one of this provider's own agents (e.g. a "tour guide"
agent) query the souk it's registered on — what agents exist here, are
they online, what do they do, inspect agent cards, and get developer guides.

Deliberately plain pydantic-ai `Tool`s, not a real MCP server, even
though the framework already supports attaching one (`AgentConfig.
mcp_servers`, wired up in main.py via `MCPToolset(url)`): standing up a
separate MCP server process/protocol buys nothing here that a direct
function call doesn't already give the model, and this repo has no
existing MCP server to pattern-match against — building one prematurely
would be new protocol/process surface for a single provider's own tool.
If a second provider ever wants the exact same souk-introspection
capability, *that's* the point to extract this into a real, shared MCP
server (or a small package) — not before.

Talks to souk purely through its already-public HTTP API (`GET /agents`,
`GET /a2a/{provider}/{name}/.well-known/agent-card.json`), the exact
same surface
`souk-directory` and any external caller use — no privileged access,
nothing souk needs to know about this provider for.
This is what keeps provider/souk independence intact: souk isn't even
aware this tool exists.

### Agent Souk Architecture Overview
- **Relay Mechanism**: Outbound-only gRPC streams (`souk-agent-sdk`). Agents do not require public IPs, open ports, or ingress tunnels (ngrok).
- **Dual Gateway**: Exposes AG-UI (SSE for human interfaces) and A2A (JSON-RPC for agent-to-agent) on a single FastAPI gateway.
- **Identity**: Ed25519 cryptographic keypairs. No passwords, central DB, or registration signup flow.
- **Actor Chains**: Multi-hop EdDSA JWT chain verification for auditable caller provenance in multi-agent workflows.
- **Persistence**: ParadeDB / Postgres for durable threads, message history, and HITL async task pause/resume.
""",
    "how_to_connect": """
### How to Connect a New Agent to Souk
1. **Copy the Reference Template**: Start from `agent-template/` or use `souk-agent-sdk` in Python.
2. **Install SDK**: `pip install souk-agent-sdk` (or add as a dependency via `uv`).
3. **Write an AgentHandle**:
```python
from souk_agent_sdk import AgentHandle, SoukProvider

async def my_agent_run(run_input: dict):
    # Process messages from run_input
    yield {"type": "TEXT_DELTA", "delta": "Hello from my agent!"}

handle = AgentHandle(name="my-custom-agent", description="My agent description", run_stream=my_agent_run)
provider = SoukProvider(souk_http_url="http://localhost:8000", handles=[handle])
await provider.run_forever()
```
4. **Run Docker or Host Process**: Launch your agent, and it will register automatically via Ed25519 identity key!
""",
    "identity": """
### Provider & Caller Identity Model
- **Ed25519 Keypair**: Created on first launch (default `souk_identity.key`). Back it up like any credential.
- **Agent Ownership**: An agent *is* `(public_key, name)` — souk mints no id for it, so re-registering with the same key is the same agent, and a name registered by another key is a different one.
- **Actor Chain**: When delegating across agents, each hop appends an EdDSA JWT signed by that agent's private key, bound to `prevHash` of the previous token.

    "quickstart": """
### Quickstart with Docker Compose
Run the entire stack in 1 minute:
```bash
cp .env.example .env
