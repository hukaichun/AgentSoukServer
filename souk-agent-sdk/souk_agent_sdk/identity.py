"""A provider's identity to any souk it connects to is its Ed25519
keypair — not an account souk issues, see souk/identity.py on the server
side. Generated once and persisted to disk so restarting this process
still owns the same agent_ids (a fresh key is a fresh, unrelated identity —
souk lets it register under the same `name`s without complaint, since names
aren't exclusive, but it gets *new* agent_ids with no connection to the old
ones; anything still pointed at the old agent_ids, e.g. another provider's
sub-agent delegation config, keeps talking to the orphaned identity, not
this one).

Losing this file means losing the ability to update those agent
registrations under their original agent_ids — there's no recovery flow in
this minimal version, so treat it like any other credential (back it up,
don't commit it).
